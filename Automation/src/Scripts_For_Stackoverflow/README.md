# StackOverflow_badge_counter
## Motivation for this script
I have a tendency to go to the stackoverflow website again and again to check my reputation and badges. So I made this sctipt to automate the process.<br>
## What this script does
This python scripts counts the gold, silver and bronze badges earned by the user. It also shows the user's current reputation as well as by how much the reputation has changed on that particular date, week.<br>
## Caution!!!
Make sure you replace the user_id variable on the first line of the script to your user id which can be found on the stackoverflow website. User id can be found beside the stackoverflow icon if you go to your profile page.
